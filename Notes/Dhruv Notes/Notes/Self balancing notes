bound() : bound values.Defined in utils.c 

fabsf() : function used to get absolute value of floating point

pitch_error : Angle of bot away from reference position .

pitch_error_difference : change in pitch error

pitch_correction: Correction duty cycle given to motor drivers 

absolute_pitch_correction :  absolute value of pitch correction 

pitch_rate : pitch_error_diff (pitch error difference per unit time)

P_term=kp*pitch error 
I_term=ki*pitch_area
D_term=kd*pitch_rate

Euler angles: Pitch and roll angles obtained from mpu using accelerometer and gyroscope readings


Functions:

pitch_cmd = reference angle of bot calculated using read_pid_const().setpoint

read_mpu6050(euler_angle,mpu_offset) : calculates current pitch angle using mpu

enable_mpu6050() : enables mpu and returns ESP_OK if mpu is initialized successfully.

enable_motor_driver(A,Normal_mode) Enables motor driver in normal mode

Conditions:
1)If pitch error>1 Bot is above the reference postion so bot is moved backwards by using
Setting speed of both motors by set_motor_speed(motor,motor_backward,duty cycle)

2)If pitch error<-1 Bot is below the reference postion so bot is moved forward by using
Setting speed of both motors by set_motor_speed(motor,motor_forward,duty cycle)


3)if pitch_error is between 1 and -1  bot is in the right position so bot is stopped by
set_motor_speed(motor,motor_stop,duty cycle)


Using mpu readings (read_mpu) to get offset angles and euler angles, pitch error is calculated as pitch_cmd-pitch_angle acalculate_motor_command is used to get corrected duty cycle values and stored in motor_cmdâ€¦motor_pwm bounds these values between max and min duty cycle.motor_cmd is desired pwm to be passed to bot.
